                    <aside class="notes">
                        The contribution of my thesis straddles between computational topology and computational geometry. Naturally, our methods are inspired by a fair count of ideas from both topology and geometry. Our contributions are best appreciated in the relatively recent
                        field -- Topological Data Analysis or TDA.
                        <br> Like the thesis, the talk entails two logical parts -- shape reconstruction and shape comparison. I have tried to make the ride today as gentle as possible for the audience. I will try to illuminate the trail of our investigation
                        and the pivotal turns -- sparing you of all the bells and whistles and the mathematical proves. However, an excited audience is encouraged to call upon the thesis for more details.

                        We open up the first part by introducing you to the problem of shape reconstruction. Then, we discuss the concept of vietoris-rips complex, its application in shape reconstruction and shortcomings.

                        Pretty much whatever we see can be called a shape. In topology, shapes are distinguished by the topological features they manifest. The best class of shapes one always hopes to deal with is smooth manifolds smoothly embedded in Euclidean space.
                        <br> For example, the smooth closed curve embedded in the plane on the left and the hollow torus embedded in the space on the right.

                        However, more often than not, practical applications deal with shapes that are far from being a smooth manifold. The map of the city of New Orleans can be modelled as a graph, where the intersections are thought of as the vertices, whereas the roads the
                        edges.
                        <br> Clearly, a graph is NOT a manifold -- because of the branchings at the intersections and the corners.
                        <br> As our story unfolds, we will see that our reconstruction results can handle graphs -- as well as more sophisticated and general class of shapes -- which we call geodesic spaces.

                        So, we first get the definition straight.

                        <br> Explain the picture.
                        <br> It is evident from the definition that a graph is a geodesic space, so is any compact, sub-manifold of the Euclidean space. Higher dimensional simplicial complexes are also examples of geodesic spaces.
                        <br> For the curious audience, the sphere -- if punctured at a point -- no longer remains a geodesic space.

                        <br> Well --- the goal is not very lucid --- is it? What if I say a little bird told me that the points are sampled from a shape that a topologist might care about --- can we guess what the original shape was?

                        Instead of looking at Rips complex only at one scale epsilon, we take two scales. We first collect the cycles at the lower scale. There might be some anomalous cycles --- but we kill them at the larger scale. At the end, the surviving cycles generate
                        the desired homology groups of the unknown geodesic space X.
                        <br> Such an idea of accounting for two scales is known as Persistent Homology. However, the novelty here is to recognize the two sampling parameters.
